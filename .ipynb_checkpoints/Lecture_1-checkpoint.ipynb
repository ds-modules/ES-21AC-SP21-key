By exploring this dataset we hope to get a clearer picture of the magnitude of prison and county jail overcrowding per facility and region, and the effects of realignment policies in state prisons and county jails.\n",

    "The key difference between state prisons and jails involve the process of sentencing. Prisons are designed for long term sentences, while jails are for those who are unsentenced or have short term sentences. It is important to note that short-term sentences are generally one year or less. Another difference is that prisons are larger and controlled at the state level. In contrast, jails are smaller and handled by a city or county.\n",

    "**Plotting**: Although it is possible to compare the values for designed capacity year by year and try to notice a pattern, often times it is more useful to visually inspect the information as it might reveal useful insights and provide a context for the data we are looking at.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below we drew a line plot to reflect the changes in design capacity of California's state prisons over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to plot a trend of our data we will use a `plot()` function that takes in two inputs: `plot(x, y)`, where the `x` and `y` represent two column names that you would like to plot along the x and y axis respectively. We then append this to our table's name using dot notation. This tells the computer in which table to look for those columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "To appropriately label our plot we can use `plt.xlabel('x_axis_name')` and `plt.ylabel('y_axis_name')` to label our axes and `plt.title('plot_title')` for our plot's main title. Notice that we didn't attach any particular table's name via dot notation. These are not table functions but basic plot functionalities from another Python library we loaded at the start of this notebook! In order for them to work, however, they must be run *after* you have created a plot. Take a look below!"
